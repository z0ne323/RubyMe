# RubyMe

Project use to store some `Ruby` Codes that solve some challenges of the `RootMe` website (French version of HTB)

You can find the website just [here](https://www.root-me.org/?lang=en)

To give a little context, I haven't been on this website for **YEARS**. When I started to learn cybersecurity I didn't have the best english so I used this website a **LOT** to learn new stuff!  

Anyway now I'm going back on this website, doing some challenges there is always very cool / nostalgic. To give me a little bit of a challenge, I'm only allowed to use `Ruby`, the problem is that I don't know `Ruby` so that should be pretty interesting to see !

As of now, I've done the `IRC` challenges in the programming section of the website. You can find this section just [here](https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/Programming/)!
